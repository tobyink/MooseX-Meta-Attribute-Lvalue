=head1 NAME

MooseX::LvalueAttribute - lvalue attributes for Moose

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   package MyThing;
   
   use Moose;
   use MooseX::LvalueAttribute;
   
   has name => (
      traits      => ['Lvalue'],
      is          => 'rw',
      isa         => 'Str',
      required    => 1,
   );
   
   has size => (
      traits      => ['Lvalue'],
      is          => 'rw',
      isa         => 'Int',
      default     => 0,
   );
   
   package main;
   
   my $thing = MyThing->new(name => 'Foo');
   
   $thing->name = "Bar";
   print $thing->name;   # Bar
   
   $thing->size++;
   print $thing->size;   # 1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a Moose attribute trait that provides Lvalue
accessors. Which means that instead of writing:

   $thing->name("Foo");

You can use the more natural looking:

   $thing->name = "Foo";

For details of Lvalue implementation in Perl, please see: 
L<http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines>

Type constraints and coercions still work for lvalue attributes.
Triggers still fire. Everything should just work. (Unless it doesn't.)

You can optionally import a constants called C<< lvalue >> that
expands to the full name of the attribute trait, allowing:

   use MooseX::LvalueAttribute 'lvalue';
   
   has name => (
      traits      => [ lvalue ],
      is          => 'rw',
      isa         => 'Str',
      required    => 1,
   );

This may allow Moose to compile your attribute very, very, slightly
faster, but the main advantage is aesthetic.
